wexCommerce is a minimalistic but powerful eCommerce platform built with Next.js using SSR, server actions, MongoDB and Stripe for payments.

A key design decision was made to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript due to its numerous advantages. TypeScript offers strong typing, tooling, and integration, resulting in high-quality, scalable, more readable and maintainable code that is easy to debug and test.
